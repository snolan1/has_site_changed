# has_site_changed

See the configuration parameters in the script at the top.
Set a URL and an update interval, and the script will check the URL accordingly
and let you know when there has been a change.

The script is only checking, "has the information returned by this URL changed?"
So a great use case is watching something like a static HTML page for changes.
